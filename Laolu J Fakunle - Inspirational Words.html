Maybe. But would you risk your life on them? For me, it’s a firm NO. And that’s exactly what a man without self-control is like—dangerous, directionless, and destined for disaster.</p><blockquote>“Guard your heart with all diligence, for out of it flow the issues of life.” — Proverbs 4:23</blockquote></section><section class="reflection-section"><h2>Keep Pressing Forward</h2><blockquote>"If you are not pressing, you are definitely oppressed—because those who are pressing are challenged." — Bishop David Oyedepo</blockquote><p>This echoes the words of Apostle Paul in Philippians 3:13–14 (KJV): “Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”</p><p>Let this be a word of encouragement to someone today: Keep pressing forward. Even when the journey is tough, the resistance is proof that you're moving. Don’t settle. Don’t retreat. The prize is ahead, not behind.</p></section><section><h2>Subscribe for Weekly Wisdom</h2><form action="file:///C:/Users/AC619SP/Downloads/laolu_homepage%20(4).html#" method="post"><input placeholder="Enter your email" required="True" style="padding: 0.5em; width: 60%; margin-right: 1em;" type="email"><button style="padding: 0.5em 1em;" type="submit">Subscribe</button></form></section><footer>© 2024 Laolu J Fakunle.
